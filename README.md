# IGDBWrapper
A .NET Standard wrapper for the IGDB API (https://api.igdb.com/)

Currently this will only get features I need for another ongoing project.
But the other features and endpoints will be included eventually.

Feel free to leave suggestions.

I will create a wiki entry on how to contribute when project architecture is set-up.
